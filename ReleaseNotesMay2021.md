# Release Notes For Major Update May 2021 Designing React Components Course

## All modules at least 95% new with exception of Module 7

The course has been completely re-written, basically covering the same material but with many improvements (and in HD 1080P also) 

More examples are included buiding apps using the React Context API including integrating HOC's and Context in the final module.

HOC's and Render Props
are now in the final module of the course and the focus is more on React context.  Also, the HOC and RPs discussions no longer have any
dependency on previous code like they did before.

The first two modules are more focussed on passing props and functions through a component hierarchy then in the previous course. Much
more detail is given on the ways to pass props and methods with an emphasis on the spread operator.

More effort is made to complete all coding demos without cutting and pasting code making it much easier to code along now.  The complex reducer code
has been removed and examples now have simpler reducers as examples.

A basic implementation of REST using NextJS API Routes has been added with methods for GET, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.  GET returns all records and GET
with a specific ID is not supported, though that would be simple to add.





## TailwindCSS is completely replaced with Bootstrap 4

The module for TailwindCSS has been removed and all course demos are not written in Bootstrap 4.5. There is no introductory session on Bootstrap like there was 
for Tailwind as it's assumed most people are famaliar with Bootstrap

## No dependency on JSON-SERVER

The local REST server is now built with NextJS API Routes which was introduced in NextJS version 10 so there is no reason to launch json-server in this course now.
