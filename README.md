# Course Code for [Designing React Components](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-components-designing) on Pluralsight

This GitHub repo includes the final code for all the modules in the course 

## Course Description

Creating UIs in React is all about creating independent components that seamlessly work together to present a consistent view across your web app. In this course, Designing React Components, you will gain the ability to architect and build high quality web apps, that ensures just the right components re-render as the data in your applications changes. First, you will learn how separation of concerns applies to building React components. Next, you will discover the various primitive methods for sharing data and methods between components. Finally, you will explore how to use Context for establishing shared information and use custom hooks for advanced state management. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of React component design needed to leverage re-usability and ensure consistency in your apps and code with less bugs.

## Getting Started
1. **Install [Node 16 with NPM 6.14.12](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.** - `https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-designing-react-components-course-code` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-designing-react-components-course-code/archive/master.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: `cd 02-designing-better-components` - `cd clip-02-setting-up-our-dev-environment`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`


## Directory Structure Here

Each of the 7 folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

And that will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`
