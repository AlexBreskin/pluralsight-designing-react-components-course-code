# pluralsight-designing-react-components
The master branch here is the latest updates to the Pluralsight course published by Peter Kellner in May of 2020 in the master branch.

# Course Code for [Designing React Components](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-components-designing) on Pluralsight

This GitHub repo includes the final code for all the modules in the course 


Before you start, you should install node on either your Windows or Mac computer

## Course Description

Description coming...

## Getting Started
1. **Install [Node 12.16.3 with NPM 6.14.4](https://nodejs.org)**. 
2. **Clone this repository.** - `https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-designing-react-components-course-code` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-designing-react-components-course-code/archive/master.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: `cd 02-designing-better-components` - `cd clip-030-components-to-code`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`


## Directory Structure Here

Each of the 5 folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

And that will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`

Starting in module 4, clip 4,  you'll need to launch the `json-server` to simulate a REST server.  To do that, you enter the command at a terminal or DOS prompt:

`npm run json-server`

## Background

This course uses the Next.js framework as a demonstraton vehicle for React Hooks. If you want to know more about Next.js you should watch my other course on Pluralsight titled "Building Server-side Rendered React Apps for Beginners". You can find it [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/building-server-side-rendered-react-apps-beginners).
